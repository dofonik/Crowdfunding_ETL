# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 (Group 2) - UWA Data Analytics Bootcamp

The 'Main' folder contains the ETL_Mini_Project.ipynb file which is the main code for this project.
This code uses the .xlsx files found in the Resources folder, and performs various data loading and cleaning operations. This code also exports the final products as CSV files that can also be found in the Resources folder.

Also found in the 'Main' folder are the following:
 - crowdfunding_db_schema.sql - this file creates the tables necessary to import the CSV files in the Resources folder and selects them for viewing.
 - Crowdfunding_ERD.png - a diagram of the schema/tables
